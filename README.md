## Software Engineer

Just a guy writing code and hacking around interesting things.

My career started as a web dev, then I mainly fought with Machine Learning in Python.
Now I'm focused on Software Engineering and Infrastructure.

* You can find my PRs in Rust [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pulls?q=author%3Amslapek) and
[there](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/pulls?q=author%3Amslapek). There's something in [Go](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/12088#event-10401905077).
I wrote a few [blog entries](https://dev.to/mslapek) about these programming languages.
* I have broad interests, including stuff related to computing (wow!). I even released [a Unity puzzle game for the iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frog-and-saw/id6468486395).
* Here are my [cloud and K8s certs](https://www.credly.com/users/mslapek) if you're into the thing.
