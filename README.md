## Software Engineer

Just a guy writing code and hacking around interesting things.

My career started as a web dev, then I mainly fought with Machine Learning in Python.
Now I'm focused on Software Engineering and Infrastructure.

* You can find my PRs to SQL engines in Rust [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pulls?q=author%3Amslapek) and
[there](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/pulls?q=author%3Amslapek).
* I wrote a few [blog entries](https://dev.to/mslapek) about Rust.
* I have broad interests, including stuff related to computing (wow!).
